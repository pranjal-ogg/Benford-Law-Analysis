# Benford-Law-Analysis
# 🌌 Star Data Exploration – Cosmic Insights Through EDA

Welcome to a stellar journey into space through the lens of data!  
This project applies **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** techniques to a real-world star dataset to uncover patterns, outliers, and even test if **Benford’s Law** holds true in the cosmos.

---

## 📁 Project Overview

We analyzed a dataset containing key information about stars, including:
- **Visual Magnitude** (how bright they *are*)
- **Apparent Magnitude** (how bright they *appear* from Earth)
- **Distance (light-years)**

Our goals:
- Understand the distribution of these variables
- Spot anomalies and outliers
- Analyze inter-variable relationships
- Test for natural patterns using **Benford’s Law**

---

## 📊 Key EDA Techniques Used

- Histograms & KDE plots
- Boxplots for outlier detection
- Scatter plots for bivariate relationships
- Correlation matrix heatmap
- First-digit analysis with Benford’s Law

## 🚀 Crazy & Cool Findings

- Most stars are faint — but a few are **unbelievably bright** outliers.
- Brightness ≠ closeness — some of the **brightest stars are extremely far**.
- Outliers often represent the **most scientifically interesting cases**.
- Surprisingly, **Benford’s Law holds true** — even for star distances and brightness!
